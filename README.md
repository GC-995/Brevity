# News Aggregator

A news aggregator website that is currently under development.
Being developed using the MERN stack, tailwind CSS, NewsAPI and some other technologies.
The idea is to develop a website which gathers news from multiple sources using an API and displays them conveniently in one place.
Also adding a news summary feature for each article fetched.
Will kinda be like a RSS aggregator with some additional features.
