# Brevity - News Aggregator

A news aggregator website that is currently under development.  
Being developed using the MERN stack, tailwind CSS, NewsAPI and some other technologies.  
The idea is to develop a website which gathers news from multiple sources using an API and displays them conveniently in one place.  
Also adding a news summary feature for each article fetched.  
Will kinda be like a RSS aggregator with some additional features.  

If u find any bug, problem or just have a suggestion in mind, kindly create an [issue](https://github.com/GC-995/Brevity/issues) and I will look into it.  

Didn't include node modules and the .env file with the API key so if u wanna run locally, a simple 'npm i' command and creating a new .env file (in the server directory) should do. If u feel like contributing, feel free to make a pull request.
